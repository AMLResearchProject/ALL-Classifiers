The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid Leukemia Research Project is being organized and developed by a group of volunteers with experience in Leukemia research, computer vision and Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics among other areas of expertise. The group is currently made up of the following members:

- Adam Milton-Barker - Bigfinite IoT Network Engineer & Intel Software Innovator.
- Ho  Leung Ng - Kansas State University, Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics.
- John LaRocco  -  Professor @ Miskatonic University, Arkham, Massachusetts.

This area of the research project focuses on Computer Vision, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks & Deep Learning Neural Networks, for detection purposes. The ComputerVision repo is maintained by Adam Milton-Barker - Bigfinite IoT Network Engineer & Intel Software Innovator, with the help of [research papers](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/Research/blob/master/Papers/CNN-AML-Papers.md "research papers") provided by Ho Leung Ng - Kansas State University Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics, and a [data set](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/ "data set") provided by Fabio Scotti - Associate Professor @ Universit√† degli Studi di Milano.
