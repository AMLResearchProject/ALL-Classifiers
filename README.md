This area of the Peter Moss AML(Acute Myeloid Leukemia) Research Project focuses on Computer Vision research and development, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks for detection/early detection purposes. 

The AML Research Project is being organized and developed by a team of volunteers with experience in Leukemia research, computer vision, biochemistry & molecular biophysics among other areas of expertise. The team is currently made up of:

- [Adam Milton-Barker](https://github.com/AdamMiltonBarker "Adam Milton-Barker") - Bigfinite IoT Network Engineer & Intel Software Innovator.
- [Ho Leung Ng](https://github.com/holeung "Ho  Leung Ng") - Kansas State University, Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics.
- John LaRocco - Former Humai Head of Engineering, LA, USA.
- [Amita Kapoor](https://github.com/amita-kapoor "Amita Kapoor") - Associate Professor @ Delhi University, New Dehli, India.
