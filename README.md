This area of the Peter Moss AML(Acute Myeloid Leukemia) Research Project focuses on Computer Vision research and development, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks for detection/early detection purposes. 

The AML Research Project is being organized and developed by a team of volunteers with experience in Leukemia research, computer vision, biochemistry & molecular biophysics among other areas of expertise. The team is currently made up of:

- [Adam Milton-Barker](https://github.com/AdamMiltonBarker "Adam Milton-Barker") - Bigfinite IoT Network Engineer & Intel Software Innovator.
- [Ho Leung Ng](https://github.com/holeung "Ho  Leung Ng") - Kansas State University, Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics.
- John LaRocco - Former Humai Head of Engineering, LA, USA.
- [Amita Kapoor](https://github.com/amita-kapoor "Amita Kapoor") - Associate Professor @ Delhi University, New Dehli, India.

# Projects

# Dataset
The [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/) dataset is used for this project. The dataset was created by [Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/). Big thanks to Fabio for his research and time put in to creating the dataset and documentation, it is one of his personal projects. You will need to follow the steps outlined [here](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download) to gain access to the dataset.
