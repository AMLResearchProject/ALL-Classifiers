# Introduction
The Peter Moss Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Caffe Classifiers are a collection of projects that use computer vision written in Python with Caffe to classify Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in unseen images.

&nbsp;

# DISCLAIMER
These projects should be used for research purposes only. The purpose of the projects is to show the potential of Artificial Intelligence for medical support systems such as diagnosis systems.

Although the classifiers are accurate and show good results both on paper and in real world testing, they are not meant to be an alternative to professional medical diagnosis.

Developers that have contributed to this repository have experience in using Artificial Intelligence for detecting certain types of cancer. They are not a doctors, medical or cancer experts.

Please use these systems responsibly.
