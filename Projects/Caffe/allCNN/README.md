# Introduction
The AllCNN Caffe Classifier is a Caffe network created by following the work in the research paper: [Acute Myeloid Leukemia Classification Using Convolution Neural Network In Clinical Decision Support System](https://airccj.org/CSCP/vol7/csit77505.pdf "Acute Myeloid Leukemia Classification Using Convolution Neural Network In Clinical Decision Support System").

&nbsp;

# Network Layers
The Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Convolutional Neural Network uses prototxt files to define the network layers.

&nbsp;

# Training Data

**ALL_IDB1** from the [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/ "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing") datasets is used in this project, to use this dataset you must request access by visiting [this section of the website](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download "this section of the website").
