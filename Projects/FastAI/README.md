# Introduction
The FastAI classifier projects are a collection of projects that use computer vision programs written using FastAI to classify Acute  Lymphoblastic Leukemia in unseen images.

The idea of using FastAI for fast prototyping of models was introduced to the project by [Salvatore Raieli](https://www.leukemiaresearchassociation.ai/team/salvatore-raieli  "Salvatore Raieli") who provided a Google Colab notebook that used FastAI with [Resnet50](Resnet50 "Resnet50") and **ALL_IDB2** from the [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/ "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing") dataset.

# DISCLAIMER
These projects should be used for research purposes only. The purpose of the projects is to show the potential of Artificial Intelligence for medical support systems such as diagnosis systems.

Although the classifiers are accurate and show good results both on paper and in real world testing, they are not meant to be an alternative to professional medical diagnosis.

Developers that have contributed to this repository have experience in using Artificial Intelligence for detecting certain types of cancer. They are not a doctors, medical or cancer experts.

Salvatore Raieli is a bioinformatician researcher and PhD in Immunology, but does not work in medical diagnosis.

Please use these systems responsibly.
