The dataset was created by [Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/). Big thanks to Fabio for his research and time put in to creating the dataset and documentation, it is one of his personal projects.

    "I decided to use some augmentation proposals outlined in Leukemia Blood Cell Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network by T. T. P. Thanh, Caleb Vununu, Sukhrob Atoev, Suk-Hwan Lee, and Ki-Ryong Kwon. The augmentations I chose were grayscaling, histogram equalization, horizontal and vertical reflection and gaussian blur to start with. Using these techniques so far I have been able to increase a dataset from 49 positive and 49 negative images to 683 positive and 683 negative, with more augmentations to experiment with. \n",

    "\n",
    "In general grayscaled images are not as complex as color images and result in a less complex model. In the paper the authors described using grayscaling to create more data easily. To create a greyscale copy of each image I wrapped the built in OpenCV function, [cv2.cvtColor()](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_colorspaces/py_colorspaces.html). The created images will be saved to the relevant directories in the default configuration.\n",
