    "\n",
    "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) [1] is a rare and very agressive form of Leukemia. With this type of Leukemia early dectection is crucial but as of yet there are no warning signs, there are currently no ways to screen for AML but there are symptoms that give warning [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project shows how we can use transfer learning and existing image classification models to create Deep Learning Models, specifically Inception V3, that can classify positive and negative Acute Myeloid Leukemia positive and negative lymphocytes in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being one of the most common forms of Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a still a relatively rare form of Leukemia that is more common in adults, but does affect children also. AML is an agressive Leukemia where white blood cells mutate, attack and replace healthy red blood cells, effectively killing them. \n",
    "\n",
    "\"About 19,520 new cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Most will be in adults (United States).\" [6]\n",
    "\n",
    "In comparrison, there are 180,000 women a year in the United States being diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), a type of breast cancer which forms in the breast duct and invades the areas surrounding it [7].\n",

    "The Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing dataset is used for this project. The dataset was created by Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Università degli Studi di Milano.

    "## The Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Movidius Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The AML Movidius Classifier shows how to train a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow [8] and transfer learning trained on a dataset of Acute Myeloid Leukemia negative and positive images, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing [9]. The Tensorflow model is trained on the AI DevCloud [10] converted to a format compatible with the Movidius NCS by freezing the Tensorflow model and then running it through the NCSDK [11]. The model is then downloaded to an UP Squared, and then used for inference with NCSDK. \n",

    "Figure 1. Inception v3 architecture ([Source](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/inception)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional neural networks are a type of deep learning neural network. These types of neural nets are widely used in computer vision and have pushed the capabilities of computer vision over the last few years, performing exceptionally better than older, more traditional neural networks; however, studies show that there are trade-offs related to training times and accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "Transfer learning allows you to retrain the final layer of an existing model, resulting in a significant decrease in not only training time, but also the size of the dataset required. One of the most famous models that can be used for transfer learning is the Inception V3 model created by Google This model was trained on thousands of images from 1,001 classes on some very powerful devices. Being able to retrain the final layer means that you can maintain the knowledge that the model had learned during its original training and apply it to your smaller dataset, resulting in highly accurate classifications without the need for extensive training and computational power.\n",

    "Through my role as an Intel® Software Innovator, I get access to the latest Intel® technologies that help enhance my projects.

    "# Interactive Tutorial\n",
    "This Notebook serves as an interactive tutorial that helps you set up your project, sort your data and train the Convolutional Neural Network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "There are a few steps you need to tae to set up your AI DevCloud project, these steps are outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Clone The Github Repo\n",
    "You need to clone the Acute Myeloid Leukemia Classifiers Github repo to your development machine. To do this open up a terminal  and use __git clone__ to clone to the AML Classifiers repo (__https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Classifiers.git__). Once you have cloned the repo you should nagivate to __AML-Classifiers/Python/_Movidius/__ to find the related code, notebooks and tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  - Gain Access To ALL-IDB\n",
    "You you need to be granted access to use the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing dataset. You can find the application form and information about getting access to the dataset on [this page](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download) as well as information on how to contribute back to the project [here](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/results.php). If you are not able to obtain a copy of the dataset please feel free to try this tutorial on your own dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Data Augmentation\n",
    "Assuming you have received permission to use the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing, you should follow the related Notebook first to generate a larger training and testing dataset. Follow the AML Classifier [Data Augmentation Notebook](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Classifiers/blob/master/Python/Augmentation.ipynb) to apply various filters to the dataset. If you have not been able to obtain a copy of the dataset please feel free to try this tutorial on your own dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data augmentations included are as follows...\n",
    "\n",
    "Done:\n",
    "- Grayscaling\n",
    "- Histogram Equalization\n",
    "- Reflection\n",
    "- Gaussian Blur\n",
    "- Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "ToDo:\n",
    "- Shearing\n",
    "- Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "You can follow the progress of the data augmentation system on this [Github issue](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Classifiers/issues/1).\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Upload Project To AI DevCloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you need to upload the related project from the repo to the AI DevCloud. The directory you need to upload is __AML-Classifiers/Python/_Movidius/__. Once you have uploaded the project structure you need to upload your augmented dataset created in the previous step. Upload your data to the __0__ and __1__ directories in the __Model/Data/__ directory, you should also remove the init files from these directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have completed the above, navigate to this Notebook and continue the tutorial there. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prepare The Dataset\n",
    "Assuming you have uploaded your data, you now need to sort the data ready for the training process. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sorting Job\n",
    "You need to create a shell script (provided below) that is used to create a job for sorting your uploaded data on the AI DevCloud. Before you run the following block make sure you have followed all of the steps in __Upload Project To AI DevCloud__ above."
