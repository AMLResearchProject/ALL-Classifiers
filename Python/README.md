# Acute Myeloid Leukemia Research Python Classifier
![Acute Myeloid Leukemia Research Python Classifier](../Media/Images/Banner-Social.jpg) 

The Acute Myeloid Leukemia Research Python Classifier is a pure Python Convolutional Neural Network created using minimal 3rd party libraries / frameworks. The classifier is part of the Peter Moss AML(Acute Myeloid Leukemia) Research Project computer vision R&D and the focus is detection/early detection of AML cells in slides. 

To run your own classifier you should follow the tutorials and Notebooks linked below:

- [Adam Milton-Barker](https://github.com/AdamMiltonBarker "Adam Milton-Barker"): [Python Data augmentation](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-Classifiers/tree/master/Python/Augmentation.md "Python Data augmentation") - A Python tutorial and Notebook for applying filters to the original dataset and increasing the amount of training / test data.

# Dataset
The [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/) dataset is used for this project. The dataset was created by [Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Università degli Studi di Milano](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/). Big thanks to Fabio for his research and time put in to creating the dataset and documentation, it is one of his personal projects. You will need to follow the steps outlined [here](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download) to gain access to the dataset.
