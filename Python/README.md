# Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Python Classifiers
![Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Detection System](../Media/Images/banner.png)
The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Python classifiers are a collection of projects that use computer vision written in Python to classify Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia in unseen images. The projects include classifiers made with Tensorflow, Caffe, Intel Movidius (NCS & NCS2), OpenVino and pure Python classifiers. 

# Data Augmentation
The [Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Classifier Data Augmentation](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Classifiers/tree/master/Augmentation "Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Classifier Data Augmentation") program applies filters to datasets and increases the amount of training / test data.
