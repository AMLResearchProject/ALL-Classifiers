# Acute Myeloid Leukemia Python Classifier
![Peter Moss AML Classifier Projects](../Media/Images/banner.png) 

The AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) Python Classifier is a pure Python Convolutional Neural Network created using minimal 3rd party libraries / frameworks. The classifier is part of the Peter Moss AML (Acute Myeloid Leukemia) AI Research Project computer vision R&D with the focus of detection/early detection of AML.

# Datasets
The [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/) dataset is used for this project. The dataset was created by [Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Università degli Studi di Milano](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/). Big thanks to Fabio for his research and time put in to creating the dataset and documentation, it is one of his personal projects. You will need to follow the steps outlined [here](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download) to gain access to the dataset.
