# Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Python FastAI Classifier Projects
![Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Python FastAI Classifiers](../../Media/Images/banner.png)
The Peter Moss Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia Python FastAI classifier projects are a collection of projects that use computer vision programs written using FastAI to classify Acute Myeloid/Lymphoblastic Leukemia in unseen images.

The idea of using FastAI for fast prototyping of models was introduced to the project by [Salvatore Raieli](https://github.com/salvatorera "Salvatore Raieli") who provided a Google Colab notebook that used FastAI with [Resnet50](https://github.com/AMLResearchProject/AML-ALL-Classifiers/tree/master/Python/_FastAI/Resnet50 "Resnet50") and __ALL_IDB2__ from the [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/ "Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing") dataset.

The FastAI Classifiers are a work in progress and aim to compare various classifiers made using FastAI to see which models work the best for detecting Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
