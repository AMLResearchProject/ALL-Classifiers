![Peter Moss Acute Myeloid Leukemia Computer Vision Research Project ](Media/Images/Banner-Social.jpg) 

This area of the Peter Moss Acute Myeloid Leukemia Research Project focuses on Computer Vision, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks, for detection purposes. 

The project is being organized and developed by a group of volunteers with experience in Leukemia research, computer vision and Biochemistry & molecular biophysics among other areas of expertise. 

The group is currently made up of:

- Adam Milton-Barker - Bigfinite IoT Network Engineer & Intel Software Innovator.
- Ho  Leung Ng - Kansas State University, Dept. Biochemistry & Molecular Biophysics.
- John LaRocco  -  Professor @ Miskatonic University, Arkham, Massachusetts.
- Amita Kapoor  -   Associate Professor @ Delhi University, New Dehli, India.

With access to the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing data set provided by Fabio Scotti - Associate Professor @ Università degli Studi di Milano.

# Research papers followed

# Dataset  

The [Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/) dataset is used for this project. The dataset was created by [Fabio Scotti, Associate Professor Dipartimento di Informatica, Università degli Studi di Milano](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/). Big thanks to Fabio for his research and time put in to creating the dataset and documentation, it is one of his personal projects. You will need to follow the steps outlined [here](https://homes.di.unimi.it/scotti/all/#download) to gain access to the dataset.
